**IMPORTANT: This tool is superseded by [cli-template](https://github.com/tongueroo/cli-template).**  This tool still works and generates a fine CLI. The new one supports namespacing with colon in the commands.

`thor_template` is a generator tool that builds a starter CLI project based on [Thor](). This blog post, [Build Thor CLI Project in Under a Second](https://blog.boltops.com/2017/09/14/build-thor-cli-project-in-under-a-second), also covers usage and also contains a video demo.

## Installation

```sh
gem install thor_template
```

thor_template new mycli

rspec --pattern spec/\*\*\{,/\*/\*\*\}/\*_spec.rb
